<h1>About Me</h1>

Hello, My name is Raekwon!

I'm actively pursuing a career in IT, I enjoy helping others with their technical issues and learning the ins and outs of technology along the way.
Growing up, I was always fascinated by computers. I was curious about how computers worked, how websites were built, and how software powered the world around us. My interest in IT started with small moments like experimenting with computers, customizing phone software, and even troubleshooting tech issues for my family and friends.
During High School, I took Computer Tech 1 & 2 and I loved it. In that time, I learned the basic functions of computers and their components. In class, we developed projects on the motherboard and the different components around it. We also learned how to install applications onto the computer and test for viruses. This led me to explore the world of Information Technology, and today, it's my chosen profession.

The IT industry is constantly evolving, offering endless opportunities to learn and grow. From artificial intelligence to cybersecurity, there is always something new to explore. I chose IT because it allows me to be creative, solve complex problems, and contribute to technological advancements. Like any field, IT comes with its challenges. I struggled to learn complex algorithms so, I decided to take online courses, get hands-on practice, and get guidance from mentors. Over time I improved my skills, and overcoming my struggles made me more confident in my choice. My overall goal is to specialize in Hardware Technology to design, and manufacture IT hardware. I want to contribute to technological advancements that improve lives, whether through innovative applications, secure digital systems, or intelligent automation. 

The world of technology is vast, and the opportunities are limitless. If you have a passion for problem-solving and innovation, IT is a field that will reward you in ways you never imagined. Choosing IT as my profession was one of the best decisions I ever made. It's a field that challenges me, excites me, and offers endless opportunities. For anyone considering IT, I'd say: "Embrace the learning process, stay focused, don't give up, and never stop exploring!"
